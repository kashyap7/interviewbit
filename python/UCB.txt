Hi everyone! This is a post relevant for people targeting a masters program starting Fall 2018.
UC Berkeley is inviting referrals from current grad students and alumni for prospective 2018 cohort. The Master of Engineering degree (offered by the Fung Institute at Berkeley) is a 2 semester program, with a mix of technical and leadership/communication curriculum. Following are the majors offered (putting the relevant ones only):
1) Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)
2) Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)
3) Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)
You can read the details of the program here: https://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/…/engineering-concentra…/
I will require a short (~200 words) paragraph on why you want to apply to this program, in order to put a referral. Please send it in an email to akshatk7@gmail.com. No need to create a PDF, a para in the body of the email would work. The institute will then contact you and give more details about the program! Feel free to ping me with any questions. :)
Note: In no way this aids your application. But you could get some face time with the admissions committee, and that could help.
